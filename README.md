# SoundClassifier
In this project I'm using CNN for urban sound classification.
The project is based on [Urban Sound 8k dataset](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html)

## Requirments
You can install requirements using the following command
```[shell]
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```
## Model results
After 90 epochs model accuracy is about 80%
