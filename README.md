# SoundClassifier
In this project I'm using CNN for urban sound classification.
The project is based on [Urban Sound 8k dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chrisfilo/urbansound8k)

## Requirments
You can install requirements using the following command
```[shell]
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```
## Loading data
You need to create data folder, download [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chrisfilo/urbansound8k) and put all files to data folder.
## Model results
After 90 epochs model accuracy is about 80%
